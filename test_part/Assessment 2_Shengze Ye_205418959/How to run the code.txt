    -- q2_short_encode.m, q2_short_decode.m
	encode and decode implementation for short sequence of question 2
    -- q2_long_encode.m
	encode process for long sequence of question 2

    -- q3_short_encode.m, q3_short_decode.m
	encode and decode implementation for short sequence of question 3
    -- q3_long_encode.m
	encode process for long sequence of question 3

For question 2, run q2_short_encode.m to get the result of encoding and then run q2_short_decode.m to get the result of decoding for short sequence
q2_short_decode.m must be run after the q2_short_encode.m
Run q2_long_encode.m to get the result of encoding long sequence

For question 3, run q3_short_encode.m to get the result of encoding and then run q3_short_decode.m to get the result of decoding for short sequence
q3_short_decode.m must be run after the q3_short_encode.m
Run q3_long_encode.m to get the result of encoding long sequence
